## 📝 Strategy Notes
- **Pricing Basis:** Verified against the latest closing prices (Feb 25, 2026) in the `sector_etfs.db`.
- **Drift Protection:** XLV (Healthcare) has been removed from the core defensive sleeve and replaced with XLP to restore negative correlation to SPY.
- **Overweight Rationale:** Energy (XLE) remains the primary geopolitical hedge, while XLU and XLP provide a low-volatility anchor.
