# CONTEXT_HUB.md - Operational Continuity

## 🎯 Current Focus (Session: 2026-02-28 09:10 AM)
- **Primary Task:** Strengthening Infrastructure (GitHub, Email, Jira) and Portfolio Optimization.
- **Goal:** transition Project Alpha from POC to structured startup operation.
- **Model:** Switching logic fallback to MiniMax for complex reasoning due to API limits.

## ✅ Accomplishments (Today)
- [x] Switched model to `gemini-flash`.
- [x] Performed Style Drift Breakdown (Identified XLV as primary driver at 0.2784 correlation).
- [x] Executed 90-Day Backtest Comparison (XLV vs XLP).
- [x] Updated Strategy Baseline to V1.1 (Swapped XLV for XLP).
- [x] Constructed $20,000 Model Portfolio Snapshot (2K_Alpha_POC_model_portfolio.md).
- [x] Initialized Git and Pushed code to GitHub (`Project_Alpha_POC`).
- [x] Implemented `PROJECT_PROFILE.md` and `CONTEXT_HUB.md` for operational continuity.
- [x] Verified Email Service (Milestone 2): Test sent successfully to hqzhang2@yahoo.com.
- [x] Built `reports_engine.py`: Daily automated portfolio snapshots are now operational.
- [x] Jira Integration (Milestone 3): Successfully authenticated with `h-zhang.atlassian.net` (Project: Alpha_POC [KAN]).

## 🔜 Next Steps & Open Tasks
1. **Jira Synchronization:** Populate the `KAN` board with identified tasks from CONTEXT_HUB.md.
2. **Database Migration:** Draft complete (see `POSTGRESQL_MIGRATION.md`). Pending host provision.
3. **Drift Monitoring:** Continue tracking XLP and XLU correlations.

## ⚠️ Active Blockers / Notes
- **API Limits:** Monitor Gemini rate limits; use MiniMax for coding/math heavy turns.
- **Matplotlib Absence:** Continuing with ASCII/CLI reporting for now.
