# Project Alpha: Strategy Baseline V1.1 (Stress-Adjusted)

## 1. Overview
A cross-asset defensive strategy designed to outperform the S&P 500 (SPY) by minimizing tail risk in volatile macro conditions.

## 2. Strategic Bias (Updated Feb 28, 2026)
- **Overweight:** Energy (XLE), Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), Gold (GLD).
- **Underweight:** Technology (XLK), Consumer Discretionary (XLY).
- **Recent Swap:** Replaced Healthcare (XLV) with Consumer Staples (XLP) due to XLV's "Style Drift" (correlation to SPY rose to 0.2784, driven by Eli Lilly growth momentum). XLP currently offers superior diversification with a negative correlation of -0.1404 to SPY.
- **Philosophy:** Alpha through variance reduction. Protecting the downside allows for superior compound growth.

## 3. Backtest Benchmarks (90-Day Comparison - Feb 28, 2026)
- **Portfolio Return (V1.1):** +13.10%
- **SPY Return:** +4.51%
- **Alpha:** +8.59% (859 bps)
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 2.49
- **VaR (95%):** -1.40%

## 4. Current Geopolitical Context
Specifically optimized for "Energy Supply Shock" scenarios. The portfolio remains overweight XLE to benefit from crude oil volatility while utilizing XLP and XLU as non-correlated equity anchors during growth-sector sell-offs.
