- Discussed Project Alpha Phase 2 with Hong. The plan is to implement a 'Correlation Drift Monitor' to add a feedback loop to the institutional strategy.
- Hong is writing the `drift_monitor.py` script, which will pull 90 days of returns for 12 tickers from `sector_etfs.db`, calculate a rolling 60-day Correlation Matrix, detect 'Convergence' (significant increase in average correlation between defensive assets and SPY), and save a CSV/text-based matrix snapshot.
- Encountered an issue with `drift_monitor.py`: 'No data found for drift analysis', likely due to date formatting/range in the SQL query. Hong will adjust the script to be more flexible with the date range and verify data in `daily_prices`.
- Hong plans to have the first Drift Report ready for review tomorrow morning.
