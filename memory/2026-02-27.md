## Project Alpha POC - Drift Monitor Analysis - Next Steps and Considerations:

1.  **Threshold Review:** Evaluate if the current `CONVERGENCE_THRESHOLD` (0.10) is the appropriate level for what is considered "significant" style drift.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate why the defensive assets' correlations to the market are consistently higher. Consider macroeconomic trends, sector-specific events, or changes in market dynamics.
3.  **Portfolio Re-evaluation:** Depending on risk tolerance and investment objectives, consider:
    *   Reassessing the suitability of the current defensive assets.
    *   Exploring other assets with historically lower correlations to `SPY`.
    *   Adjusting portfolio weightings to mitigate the impact of this drift.
4.  **Visualization:** Plotting the historical average correlation alongside the threshold could provide a clearer visual understanding of these trends.
